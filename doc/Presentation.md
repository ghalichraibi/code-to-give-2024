# StepByStep: Empowering Women Through Every Step of Their Journey: Oral Presentation

Hi everyone! I'm here today to talk to you about the result of the collaborative effort of 10 people, 3 sleepless nights and a lot of hair-pulling code: what is hopefully Le Chainon's next innovative web platform: StepByStep, a tool to help empower women through every step of their journey. A lot of us came in this hackathon with little to no experience in big projects like this but hey, with a go-getter attitude and a 25$ uber eats voucher we dug in. *hahaha*. We came up with an innovative user-friendly interface that is very complexe but feels so easy to use. Whether you're a caregiver or a resident, with just a few clicks you can get the information you need when you need it. Let's dig into said features, shall we? As a Caregiver, you can interactively create and modify plans, you can get global statistics, you can set reminders or schedule meetings or events with various residents and most importantl, you can, at anytime, open a chat with a specifc resident and check up on them from anywhere in the world. Now for the real stars of the show, the residents we worked as hard as we could to insure just about anybody no matter the comfort with technology could navigate through this platform swiftly. **Begin ScreenShare Here** StepByStep has you
